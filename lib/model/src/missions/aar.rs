AAR: Contractors were tasked with destroying Cartel Assets on the island nation of Tanoa. Contractors began by assaulting the airfield. There was a handful of armed cartel members present at the airfield, which were taken out in the assault. A Cartel owned C-130, Mohawk Transport Helicopter, and Fuel Truck was destroyed. The ATC tower was resistant to demolition charges, so one was set in the tower itself to destroy the electronics inside of the tower itself. From the airfield, contractors regrouped at the FOB, and then began to make their way to the town of Tavu. A siege of the town began to neutralize the cartel presence within the town. In the early moments of contact with the cartel, both FTL's were KIA. After regrouping and triaging patients, the remaining cartel members were neutralized. 7 cartel owned RHIB's were destroyed, 2 cartel owned vans were destroyed, and 5 crates of cartel product were destroyed. Contractors successfully exfil'd back to the fob.

Operation Successful.

AAR: Contractors split into two teams between Mandalaria and Barawas (Yellow and Blue, respectively). At Barawas, Blue team took heavy contact, requiring assistance from a mobilized Yellow team (that at the time was checking Kouble Maimatara). After the end of the firefight, Yellow moved to Mimi, to check the area for any ISAS activity, before returning to to Mandalari. At 0800, Blue was experiencing no contact, while Yellow was awaiting the arrival of the convoy to Mandalari. The convoy was taken out by RPG fire, and contractors engaged the sparse contact that remained after the main force retreated. Afterwards, Yellow sent a two man team to patrol Kouble Maimatara, ending up surrounding and KIA. The rest of Synixe contractors assaulted the town to upend the ISAS fighters that were in the town, and recover the bodies of the 2 man team. After 20 or so minutes of heavy combat, where contractors were assaulted from all directions, ISAS retreated from the town, only after the number of KIA contractors tripled (All but one of Yellow was KIA, One of Blue was KIA). Bodies were secured, and the remainder of the contractors RTB'd.
