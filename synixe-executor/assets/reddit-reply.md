Hey, come check out Synixe Contractors! https://synixe.contractors

We play every Friday and Saturday at 7pm PST / 10pm EST. We are a semi milsim unit. We take our missions and objectives seriously, but without ranks or basic training. Our specialized roles require certification, and we do offer training to anyone that would like it.

Unlike most units we play as a persistent PMC. We get paid from our contracts and we buy and manage our own kits that persistent between missions.
