**Who are we?**

Synixe contractors is a PMC unit composed of mature mil-sim operators who pride themselves in the execution of operations on the ground. During missions we stay on point, crack some jokes, have fun and get the job done. Outside of them we are a laidback and friendly group to be around. Contracts are handmade to add a personal touch and in between them we hang out in our Discord and even participate in other games as a group and in general just enjoy gaming with each other.

**What sets us apart:**

* A persistent gear system, you are paid for contracts in which you participate and use that money to buy gear that you get to keep.
* Serious attitude during ops, relaxed one outside of them
* No ranks, so no yes-sir/no-sir routine
* Hand crafted contracts on Fridays and Saturdays
* Certifications for specialized roles and the freedom to obtain any you want. This ensures that all contractors understand and know how to effectively use the equipment they're carrying.
* Some of the certifications available include: Marksman, Engineer/EOD, MAT(Medium Anti Tank), Combat medic, Autorifleman and Rotary Wing pilot. With more certifications well underway.

**What we ask of you:**

* 18+
* A working microphone and to use TeamSpeak for communication
* A friendly attitude and a willingness to learn
* Arma 3 Apex and the Western Sahara CDLC
* That you take part in missions at least once every four weeks in order to be an active member. It's not the biggest deal if you are unable to attend for a while, after all real life takes priority
